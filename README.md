- 👋 Hi, I’m @mocoman132
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, javascript, python, c#, html, and css.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open begginer project to learn from much more knowledgeable programmers as well as having more experience coding something of my own.
